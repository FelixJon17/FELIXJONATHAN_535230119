            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <p>
                As an active student at Tarumanagara University, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering, 
                I have cultivated a strong foundation in various areas of technology and programming. My academic journey has equipped 
                me with a robust skill set, enabling me to navigate complex technical challenges with confidence. I am particularly adept at 
                working in team settings, where I contribute effectively through clear communication, collaboration, and a shared commitment to 
                achieving project goals.

                My ability to adapt quickly to new environments allows me to thrive in dynamic situations, whether it involves learning new 
                technologies or adjusting to shifting project requirements. I am also proficient in managing multiple tasks simultaneously, 
                ensuring that I maintain high levels of productivity and performance even under pressure.

                Through both my coursework and extracurricular activities, I have developed a keen understanding of the importance of perseverance, 
                problem-solving, and continuous learning in the rapidly evolving field of informatics engineering. These experiences have not only 
                honed my technical skills but also fostered a resilient mindset that is essential for success in the tech industry.
